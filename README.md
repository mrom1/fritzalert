# FRITZ!Alert

The FRITZ!Alert project is a software that allows you to monitor your network traffic in real time if you have an AVM FritzBox.

I started this project to detect P2P file sharing in my network reliably and save the evidence of the user which did share a file over P2P / torrents etc.

In my case I did not want to restrict the users of my network from their freedom of using whatever software they like, I just needed a solution for saving up evidence in case someone did something illegal. This is why I created this software.

**At the time of writing I have not published the backend code yet.**

Please understand that this software may not only help in clarifying illegal activities but may also be used with the intent of causing something illegal! \
Another reason is that at the time of writing this software is not 100% tested, and therefore I could not publish it with a peace of conscience if the gathered evidence would somehow be falsified and used in a court case or something similar.

**I will however publish bits and pieces of it in the future to make it a well-rounded proof-of-concept with no warranty!**

You may however want to check out the [live demonstration](https://mrom1.github.io/fritzalert-webclient-demo/) with no backend functionality.

I am open for discussion on this project.
